# Project part 1 For Cs219 Computer Organization
> The purpose of this project was to design a machine language simulator
> The code performs the ADD function between two hexadecimal numbers. The hexadecimal numbers were inputted from a text file called "myFile.txt"
> This program first asks the user to input a name of a file. If the program is able to identify and open the given file, then it first identifies the command "ADD" and then takes the following hexadecimal numbers that are stored in the uint32_t unsigned int.
> The program then prints out the sums calculated into the console
> If the program is unsuccessful in opening the file, the program prints an error message and exits.
